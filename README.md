# habit_tracker
The Habit Tracker is a program that works together with pixela-application through API. It helps it's users keep track of their chosen daily habits. 
When the program runs, it automatically logins into Pixela-platform through the provided api key and token. It also automatically creates a graph for the user where it displays the magnitude of the hours put into a chosen habit. This motivates the user to either intensify or reduce their effort towards their expected goal.
